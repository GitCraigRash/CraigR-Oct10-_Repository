Today I learned about the Interquartile range (IQR) in statistics.

Basicly, if you had a data set of (0,0,1,1,3,4,5,7,9)
You would find the IQR by
1)Identify the median.(3) 
	If dataset is even, skip this step.

2)Split the dataset into two using the median.
	If the dataset is even, split the dataset by half the dataset's 
length.
 
3)Find the median of the left side.
	If dataset is even, find the average of the closest to the center 
of the set. (given (1,4,5,6) avereage 4 and 5.

4)Find the median of the right side.

5)The IQR is the difference of the left median from the right median.
