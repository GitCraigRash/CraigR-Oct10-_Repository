Findings in Statistics
How do you tell if a sub-group of your population is significantly 
different than your overal population? 

In my example, is  the weight of hunted deer in Maryland significantly 
different than the weight of hunted deer in North America? 

To answer this question, we eventually need to measure the mean weight 
of deer in MD against the deer in N.America. But at what point do we say 
there is a significant difference? Wouldn't the means always be different 
by random chance or systematic error?

The Null Hypothosis
The face that the mean of the hunted deer in MD is different than all 
N.America is by chance and indistinguishable from noise. 

I.E. Hy:mu=N.America.mean() otherwise, Hy:muâ‰ N.America.mean()
